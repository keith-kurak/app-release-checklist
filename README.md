# App Release Checklist
Everything you need to get your app live on the web and the stores!

So, you've vibe-coded something cool for your phone with [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new). What's next? How do I get this to the app stores? Let's talk about that.

We'll divide this into a few different phases. Take things one step at a time, there's a handful of little and somewhat bigger things to do, but you'll get through them :).

## Last mile development and testing
_You'll want to download your app from Bolt so you can do a few things on your computer. Nothing big- mostly adding some configuration that you'll need to build the standalone version of your app and send it to the stores.

### Grab some tools
_I really like Bolt's Github connection option, so I'll focus on that. but you can also use the Export button and work with the files without connecting them to Github_
- [ ] Create a [Github](https://github.com) account.
- [ ] Download [Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) (there's other ways, but Github Desktop is super-easy; just a few clicks and you'll be syncing between Bolt and your desktop)
- [ ] Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (you'll use this to edit a few files)
- [ ] Create an [Expo](https://expo.dev) account (you'll use this to build and publish your app)
